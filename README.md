# SSL Certificates Checker

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/bjfletcher/ssl-certs-checker/master/screenshot.png)

## Motivation

Two-fold, firstly to experiment with technical patterns that are new to me and, secondly, to get some juices going regarding ensuring SSL certificates never expire on all servers that are of interest to our websites - some ideas have come out as a result of this: one-click renewals, Slack alerts to #general channel...

So, any comments on technical patterns - particularly Scala ones in `Application.scala` - and ideas are welcome. I'm `ben.fletcher` on Slack or [@bjfletcher](//twitter.com/bjfletcher) on Twitter.

## Contributing

At this stage, it's all just kind of a playground and experimental.  You're more than welcome to fork, even to orphan any of the code. :)
